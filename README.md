Analysis Between Types of Cryptocurrencies 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crypto-currency has not only grown in popularity, but in value as well. As a team, we are attempting to determine the trends occurring between each type of crypto: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, and eventually, find which one is the most valuable. We decided to create an analysis from data collected over the past 3 years (2019, 20200, and 2021) for each crypto type, to come to a decision regarding this manner. Throughout this project, the following relationships were observed: . 

We began by dropping the null values and unnecessary columns from the datasets in order to look at relevant information. After formatting and renaming the columns, we set the values in the according decimal values (e.g. values to the hundredth or ten-thousandth place). The main function that was used to reframe this dataset was using the function to convert an epoch timestap to a readable timestamp. By importing "datetime", the function was ran and converted the time to year, month, date, hour, minute, and second, respectively. We inserted the modified data into the column so that everything was fluently understood. The same code was ran through the three years for each crypto-currency.
